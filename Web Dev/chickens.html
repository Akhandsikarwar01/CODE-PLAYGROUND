    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p> <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated form of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus),
        originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most
        common and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs,
        though they are also kept as pets.</p>

    <p>
        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion,
        with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption.
        Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed
        for meat and egg production,respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce
        over 300 eggs per year.Chickens are social animals with complex vocalizations
        and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many societies.
        Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[20] Wild <u>junglefowl</u> can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too
        heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20]
        Newly hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
        however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb)
        of a heritage chicken of the same age.[22]</p>

    <p>Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of
        skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds
        have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]
        Chickens are omnivores.[24] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as
        large as lizards, small snakes,[25] and young mice.[26] A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the
        breed.[27] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[28]

        Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens
        dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest
        sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif
        Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[29][30] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in
        conflicts.[31] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young
        fox.[32] Chickens have been thought of primarily as providers of food, but their cognition, emotions, and
        sociality are comparable with other birds and mammals.[33]

        Crowing (with audio)
        <br>
        A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[34] and in
        response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call
        their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or
        on the ground.[35]</p>
